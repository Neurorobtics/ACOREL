function [ ct_clean , ct_strip ] = restrip_noise2( ct_diffs, ct_ras, max_dist )
%strip_noise Uses surface files from a 3D brain reconstruction to mask a co-registered CT
%volume such that noise which is beyond the brain's surface is excluded
%INPUT:
%           can accept a string or an array of RAS coords
%
%OUTPUT: ct_clean - a noise free array of CT points in RAS
