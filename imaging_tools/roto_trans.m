function M=roto_trans(R,T)
%% writes the 3x3 rotation and 3x1 translation to a linear transform to a Matrix 4x4 which can be read by
% read_xfm or read_lta
%INPUT:
% R - the 3x3 rotation matrix
% T - 3 x 1 translation
% 
%OUTPUT
% M - the 4x4 linear transform
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% read_xfm works by scanning til the words Linear_Tranform are detected,
% then extracting the 4 x 4 matrix that subsequently follows

%% NOTES
%The matrix $ T$ will be referred to as a homogeneous transformation matrix. 
%It is important to remember that $ T$ represents a rotation followed by a translation (not the other way around). 
%Each primitive can be transformed using the inverse of $ T$, resulting in a transformed solid model of the robot.
%The transformed robot is denoted by $ {\cal A}(x_t,y_t,\theta)$, and in this case there are three degrees of freedom. 
%The homogeneous transformation matrix is a convenient representation of the combined transformations; 
%therefore, it is frequently used in robotics, mechanics, computer graphics, and elsewhere. 
%It is called homogeneous because over $ {\mathbb{R}}^3$ it is just a linear transformation without any translation.
%The trick of increasing the dimension by one to absorb the translational part is common in projective geometry
